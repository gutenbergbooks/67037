ON THE INACCURACIES WHICH PROBABLY EXIST IN THE CENSUS RETURNS OF AGES.


                   _By Thomas A. Welton_, _F.S.S._, &c.

SOME years ago, before the publication of the third volume of the Census
of England and Wales, 1871, I was anxious to calculate the approximate
death rates in particular parts of England, amongst females at certain
ages, during each of the years 1851–1870.  I therefore applied myself to
the preliminary process of estimating the population in each year at the
ages in question.

I found that it was not safe to assume that, if population in a given
county or district had increased generally, at a certain rate, there had
been an increase at each particular age at something like the same rate.
On the contrary, there was a surprising irregularity in the respective
rates of increase or decrease observed amongst persons of the several
ages in the same population.

Table I shows the rates of increase in the numbers enumerated at each age
up to 80 amongst males and females respectively in the several
registration divisions, and in England and Wales.  On inspecting this
table, it will be seen that, partly owing to the effect of emigration,
the ratios of increase at particular ages are very diversified.  In the
Eastern Counties males aged 20–25 decreased by nearly one-tenth, but
males aged 65–70 increased by nearly a quarter.  In the same division,
females aged 25–30 decreased by almost 5 per cent., whilst females aged
40–45 increased by more than 15 per cent.

Such being the state of the facts, I abandoned all thought of deducing
from the total numbers enumerated in 1871 any reliable estimates of the
numbers at particular ages, unless indeed some other mode of treatment of
the figures could be found leading to more regular results.

On comparing with the population enumerated in 1851 the numbers, ten
years older, found to be living in 1861, I obtained other sets of ratios,
which are shown in Table II.

The following is a comparison between the proportions for England and
Wales, shewn in Table II, and the numbers out of 100 living in 1851 who
would have survived in 1861 according to the English Life Table No. 3.

50–55                 76.7          80.2          75.3          78.2
55–60                 68.9          74.1          67.7          70.7
60–65                 56.5          60.2          56.9          60.3
65–70                 47.3          50.5          43.5          47.2

The emigration of females of English birth has by no means been on an
insignificant scale, at any time since 1851; but owing to the immigration
of large numbers of women from Ireland, Scotland, and foreign parts, the
net loss has been only moderate.  We should therefore be justified in
looking for a certain correspondence between the proportions of females
who might be expected to survive, according to the Life Table, and those
proportional figures which represent a comparison of the census figures
of 1861 with those of 1851.  In point of fact, we discover that, at ages
10–20, the proportions who should survive the next ten years, according
to the Life Table, are far exceeded by those who apparently do survive;
and this state of things in the next ten years is reversed.  So that the
figures suggest a faulty return of the ages of the female population,
exaggerating the numbers aged 20–30, and perhaps depressing those aged
30–40.

Again, we have reason to believe that some of the children under five
years old are returned as being fully of that age, whilst next to none
who have attained five years of age would be returned as being younger.
This would account for the dissimilarity of the ratios of survivors at
the earliest period of life.

By assuming, as experimental suppositions, that the proportionate errors
in the censuses of 1851 and 1861 at each age were equal, and that female
emigration and immigration neutralised each other, I obtained a set of
corrections of the census enumerations of females which indicated that
there was a tendency in the case of young persons under twenty to
exaggerate their ages, but that women aged 25–30, and at each successive
quinquennial period of life, at least up to 55–60, had a tendency to
understate their ages.  There was likewise a certain disposition to
return ages in round numbers of years, though this was far less
remarkable than in the Irish census of 1851, from which the following
figures are taken.

   Age returned.       Males.       Females.
  35 and under 40        150,471       165,966
     40 ,, 45            187,410       217,986
     45 ,, 50            109,618       117,345
     50 ,, 55            156,337       176,782
     55 ,, 60             73,511        79,111
     60 ,, 65            100,963       130,740

The understatement, at the ages mentioned, appeared to have been no
greater in this country than would have resulted from _every woman_, aged
25–60, calling herself one year younger than her true age.

It will be obvious how great the utility of censuses taken at intervals
of _five_ years would be, in enabling us to measure more accurately the
results of these tendencies to mis-state ages, and particularly the
effect of ages being returned in round numbers.

The corrections applicable to the returns of males could not be even
approximately determined without taking into account the effects of
emigration upon the numbers of that sex.  And as the rates of mortality
are subject to considerable variation, year by year, I came to the
conclusion that more reliable results must be sought by the aid of—

(1)  Estimates of the numbers of the _recorded_ deaths which happened
amongst persons _born_ in each quinquennial period. {6}
(2)  A computed allowance for unregistered births in excess of the
unregistered deaths of infants.
(3)  Estimates of the loss or gain of population through migrations at
each age.

Table III exhibits the results obtained by computing the first and second
of these elements, and showing the remaining difference between the two
sets of census figures, as the combined result of migrations and errors.

On examining this table, I thought it extremely probable that the numbers
of deaths at high ages were exaggerated, because I know of no reason for
supposing that the census numbers at such ages are less than the truth;
and if they are equal to or more than the real numbers of the living, we
are compelled to conclude either that there is a considerable immigration
of old people, or, what seems much more compatible with such knowledge as
we possess, a tendency exists to exaggerate the ages both of the living
and the dying amongst those who are over seventy years old.

By the aid of the “English Life Table No. 3” it was ascertained that in a
population resulting from births increasing at 1 per cent. per annum, the
following numbers would represent the proportions of persons living and
dying at high ages:—

  Ages.            Living.            Ages.            Living.            Proportion of the

From the above table it may be deduced that, supposing persons aged 71–75
call themselves (or are described as being) on an average six months
older than their true age, and if after 75 the exaggeration averages an
entire year, a very great impression must be thereby made upon the
returns.

Having arrived thus far, I thought it would be convenient in the first
instance to try whether these suggestions, which I imagine will be deemed
moderate and probable, would suffice to explain the apparent influx of
aged persons, shown in Table III; and whether other suppositions, not
less reasonable, would serve to overcome the remaining difficulties which
appear on the face of that table.

The female population being least disturbed by migrations, the necessary
calculations were made in relation to it, before proceeding further.
First, the deaths shewn in Table III had to be modified, as follows:—

migrations of females into and from this country, and the following
estimates were provisionally adopted:—{8a}

No great confidence can be placed in these last calculations as to the
effect of migrations at particular ages.  The facts bearing on the
subject preserved in official records with which I am acquainted are but
scanty.  The rough, general idea which may be gathered from the table
does, however, approximate more or less closely to the truth, and may be
usefully contrasted with the violent fluctuations indicated in Table III.
These shew, in the midst of their extravagance, a kind of regularity at
particular ages, thus—

Finding it quite impossible to believe in the successive migrations which
must have taken place, if this extract from Table III represented the
truth, I pursued the enquiry as to what is the alternative of such a
belief.

Proceeding to calculate what corrections must be made in the census
returns of the numbers of females, if the amended estimates of losses by
death and the calculated results of migrations be adopted, I first
assumed that each of the three censuses of 1851, 1861, and 1871 might be
rendered erroneous by misstatements as to ages in _fixed proportions_ at
the several periods of life.

The endeavour to find such a fixed scale of proportions as would rectify
all the censuses was, however, unsuccessful; and it became evident that
the deviations from the truth were greatest in 1851 and least in 1871.
Three scales of proportions were then arrived at empirically, embodying
the idea of diminishing degrees of error.  In the course of the
researches made for the sake of adjusting these scales, I found reason to
believe that the allowances for unregistered births in the years 1856–60
and 1861–65 should be increased by ½ per cent.  That addition having been
made to the estimated numbers of births, it became requisite that equal
numbers should be added to the estimated losses by emigration; and by
finally amending the three scales of proportions in conformity with these
alterations, the results shewn in Table IV were at last arrived at.

These results require us to believe that, whilst our calculation of the
effect of migrations in 1851–60 was near the truth, the similar estimate
for 1861–70 was rather beside the mark.  The numbers now required to be
substituted, however, appear to me to be acceptable, especially when we
have regard to our inability to form any opinion as to the ages of those
persons of English birth who returned in large numbers from the United
States about the time of the war of secession.

The next thing to do was to ascertain what transpositions of the census
figures are involved, in case we accept the numbers shewn in Table IV as
being approximately correct.

Table V exhibits these transpositions, and it will be seen that they lead
to the conclusions shewn in the following statement:—

The ratios in the above statement signify that at no time of life does
the apparent _under statement_ of age average so much as an entire year;
{11b} and the exaggeration even at high ages also appears to average less
than a year, so that there is, I think, no such unlikelihood about the
figures as should lessen their credibility.  When the irregular results
of Table III for females are compared with the much more probable results
shewn in Table IV, and the assumptions by which the latter were arrived
at, and through the adoption of which the registered births and deaths,
the returns at successive censuses of the numbers of the female
population at several ages, and the computed losses by migration have
been brought into close agreement, are considered, I think it will be
seen that it is very much safer to adopt my corrections than to rely on
the actual returns.

As the operation by which the age-returns are to be corrected is
essentially one of transposition, I suppress the ratios upon the footing
of which I constructed Table IV, and would employ the proportions shewn
in Statement A, in applying similar corrections to the population returns
in detail.  In the absence of any means of judging what variations there
may be in different parts of the country in the extent of the
misrepresentations as to ages, I should be inclined to make use of these
proportions in every case, though not without apprehending that
inaccuracies of some consequence may thus be fallen into.

One more test may be applied before we finally adopt the figures
exhibited in Table IV as representing (very nearly) the true female
population.  The ratios borne by the population there shewn to exist in
1861 and 1871 respectively, _plus_ emigrants, to the numbers ten years
earlier, may be computed and compared with those already shewn, which
were derived from the English Life Table No. 3, thus:—

 Age at the end        Proportion of survivors            The like
   of the ten      (including emigrants) out of 100     proportion,

On examining the ratios thus obtained, it will be seen that they
harmonise well with the probability shewn by the Life Table.  Each set of
ratios is symmetrically graduated, whilst the proportions obtained by the
use of the uncorrected Census Tables were, as has already been observed,
by turns exaggerated and depressed.

Having thus arrived at a sufficiently near approximation to the truth in
the case of females, it remains for us to endeavour to do the same in
that of males.  The effect of emigration must be first computed, which
may be done thus:—

births used in compiling Table IV.

The total loss or gain of male inhabitants at each age, resulting from
the above migrations, might possibly have been as under, assuming the
course of events to have been quite unvarying year by year:—

As, however, those who departed in the earlier years of the decennium
1861–70 for the United States, may, to a great extent, have returned
home, as well as many of those who had previously left the country, it
seems natural to suppose that the emigrants of 1861–70 were, on the
whole, much younger than the above Table would shew.

The result of a careful study of the various figures has been to convince
me that the ages of male children, as well as those of female children,
are overstated.  At the age 15 and under 20 males do not appear to
exaggerate their ages so often as females do.  From 25 to 70 there seems
to be a general but slight tendency to understate age, to the extent, on
an average, of a quarter or at most nearly half a year.  After 70, the
same tendency to exaggerate age, which was noticed in the case of
females, seems to prevail.

In Tables VI and VII are contained the same approximate facts respecting
males, as are furnished by Tables IV and V for our female population.
The figures of all these statements have been arrived at empirically, but
so as to involve the most moderate and regular corrections which will
meet the difficulties of the case.

The resulting proportions of supposed accurate and inaccurate returns at
each age may be thus shewn:—

The emigration {15} at several ages shewn in Table VI, though graduated
with much regularity, is very different in amount at particular ages from
that which has been computed on page 14 (_ante_), and each person must
form his own opinion as to which set of figures is likely to be nearest
the truth.

Applying the final test previously used, by calculating the ratios of
survivors indicated by the corrected figures, we have:—

These ratios, like those obtained from the corrected female population,
shew a great deal of regularity, and resemble those derived from the
English Life Table very closely, whilst they deviate widely from those
based upon the uncorrected census figures.

It may perhaps be supposed that such resemblance is artificial, and is
really the result of the adoption of the Life Table as a guide in the
apportionment of the recorded deaths under the years of birth.  I am,
however, sure that such a use of the Life Table cannot have controlled
the result to any very important extent.  Any apportionment of deaths
occurring amongst a gradually increasing population like that of England,
effected on a consistent and reasonable plan, would necessarily come
within a very few thousands of the figures shewn in Tables IV and VI, at
least for that period of life extending over fifty years or thereabouts,
which lies between childhood and old age. {16}

There is this further remark to be made, viz., that the series of ratios,
though they resemble those derived from the Life Table, deviate from them
at particular ages to a very appreciable extent thus:—

The actual mortality seems in general to be lower than that shewn in the
Life Table, sometimes to the extent of five or six or even nine per cent.
If, therefore, we were to compute the numbers of deaths on the basis of
the Life Table, the result would be found to exceed the recorded deaths
by many thousands.  I naturally prefer to accept the teachings of the
recorded facts, although they may not have been transposed quite
correctly, rather than rely upon the Life Table,—which I feel sure has
been graduated by some mathematical process at least as empirical as any
estimate of mine.  At the same time, I think I am bound to point out that
so near a correspondence between the general character of my results and
that of those obtained by mathematical graduation is a most important
fact, tending to convince us more strongly than ever that great
regularity would be found to exist in the age-distribution of deaths
occurring amongst a large population, and during a moderately long period
of time, if only a truthful record of ages could be secured.

                APPLICATION OF THE SUGGESTED CORRECTIONS.

On applying to the census figures of 1861 and 1871 for each of the eleven
divisions, the proportional corrections shewn in Statements A and B,
certain results were obtained, of which the following is an example:—

The final result of the above calculation is a column of differences
which, if the rate of mortality in Lancashire and Cheshire exactly
equalled that of the nation, would represent the gain or loss at each age
on a balance of migrations.  The whole of the differences thus
ascertained for the eleven divisions respectively are shewn in Table
VIII.

The last column in that table, shewing the differences for England and
Wales, of course represents simply the effect of migrations.  I think
that the differences in the other columns, at ages up to 35, are almost
wholly consequent upon migrations. {19a}  The mortality in London and in
Lancashire being greater than the average, the figures at those ages are
perhaps less striking (because partially neutralised by such excessive
mortality) than if the results of migrations stood out by themselves.  It
seems clear, in fact, that whilst the South-western counties _lose_ more
than 26.8 per cent. of their young men in the ten years beginning with
age 10 to 15 and ending with age 20 to 25, London _gains_ rather more
than 14.5 per cent. at the same time of life.

The ratios last mentioned, and many others which are shewn in Table VIII,
are of great importance, as indicating the movements of large numbers of
persons, {19b} and therefore, by way of rendering our impressions about
their meaning more definite, I have taken the pains to apportion the
deaths recorded in Divisions I, V, and VIII at certain ages, with the
following results:—

Similar tables might be constructed for every age, and not only for each
registration division, but for every registration district in the
kingdom.

It will be observed that the apparent gain of the metropolitan division
through migrations is less striking than might have been expected,
although it is very large.  But what is really shewn is the _balance_
resulting, after deducting from the _gain_ of strangers, the _loss_
arising from the removal of families over the border of the division into
extra metropolitan Middlesex, Surrey and Kent, or even into the nearer
parts of Essex and Hertfordshire.  If the London boundary were largely
extended, it would be found that the _gain_ by immigration from a
distance is larger, and the _loss_ by emigration is less, than now
appears; and, in short, the statements whether of urban gain or of rural
loss at ages up to 35 would be more striking than those exhibited in
Table VIII.

After 35, both sexes in London and in the north-western counties exhibit
a steady loss at each age, no doubt attributable in the main to the heavy
mortality experienced in those divisions.  The rural divisions numbered V
and XI shew a loss until past the age of 50, due to emigration.  These
and several other agricultural divisions (those numbered II, III, and
IV), shew considerable gains at the higher ages, partly due to their
mortality being low, and partly resulting from other causes.

It is evident that those who emigrate beyond sea (from Division V for
example) are older persons than those who leave their native division to
seek employment at a short distance, as do the majority of those who
migrate from the eastern counties (Division IV).  Two-thirds of these
latter are perhaps between the ages of 14 and 20 years when they depart,
and very few of them can be more than 25 years old.

The apparent relative mortality of the sexes at certain ages must be
influenced by the dissimilar degrees of inaccuracy in the population
returns for males and females respectively, as the following short
statement will shew:—

                 Mean population           Mean population                Deaths                    Deaths per 1000.

The facts I have stated, and the experiments I have made, are perhaps
sufficient to suggest by what methods of estimation an idea can be gained
of the distribution of population as to ages, when once the total
increase or decrease is known. {22}  But they also tend to shew the
difficulties which surround the subject, and the need which exists that
enquirers should summon up sufficient courage to treat with a certain
degree of freedom the returns of the census and registration offices.

[These two Tables having been calculated simply with the object of
shewing that the proportional results obtainable by a comparison of the
numbers enumerated at successive censuses, at particular ages, do not
display sufficient regularity to justify the belief that such proportions
would be approximately maintained decennium after decennium,—it is
considered unnecessary to print them.  The remaining Tables are printed
in full, as without reference to, and careful consideration of, the facts
they display, the paper would almost lose its significance.]

TABLE III.—Shewing the enumerated population in 1851, 1861, and 1871, at
each quinquennial period of life, the estimated births in 1851–70, the

Memo.—If the mortality in each Division was exactly the same, these
ratios would truly represent loss by emigration or gain by immigration;
however, there is a good reason to think that at the higher ages the
losses are (in Divisions I and VIII especially) caused by excessive
mortality, and the gains in other Divisions are largely occasioned by the
mortality therein being below the average.




FOOTNOTES.


{4}  This should be read “0 and under 5.”

{6}  These estimates have been made upon the basis of an apportionment
derived from a consideration of the “English Life Table No. 3;” but I
refrain from going into a detailed account of the process, for fear of
rendering this paper more prolix and uninteresting than its character
necessitates.

{8a}  Net gain of incoming Irish, foreigners, &c., in excess of those
departing.  Net loss of English-born Emigrants, in excess of English
returning home.

{8b}  This is framed on the assumption that the migrations in each year
were exactly alike in number.

{11a}  It will be noticed that some of the ratios of inaccuracy
attributed to the census figures of 1851 are lower than those for later
censuses.  These exceptions to the rule of decreasing inaccuracy might be
removed without any very violent disturbance of the estimates shewn in
Table IV, but it is thought scarcely requisite to do so.

{11b}  The percentage would be 20.0 (more or less), except at high ages,
for each year of error.

{14}  Net Gain.

{15}  A further slight modification in the estimates of unregistered male
births will be noticed.  It affects the estimated emigration in 1861–70
to the extent of about 10,000 persons,—making it 156,248 instead of
165,800.

{16}  The following specimen calculation, shewing the ingredients which
constitute the computed deaths in 1861–1870 amongst females born in
1851–1855, in 1816–1820, and in 1811–1815 respectively, will illustrate
what I mean:—

{19a}  The first line of Table VIII shews the effect of the removal of
families from the first division to the semi-suburban districts in
divisions II and III.  Such families take with them a good many children;
hence the loss to the metropolitan division, and the gain to the two
divisions mentioned of both boys and girls.

{19b}  The following statement may make this fact clearer:—

   Division.      Births recorded    Population in       Proportion
                      1841–45.            1871           as 100 to—
                                     born 1841–45.
I.  London                  316037            289951              91.7
V.                          266860            126219              47.3
South-western
VIII.                       392151            279606              71.3
North-western

The survivors, according to the English Life Table No. 3, should be about
62.2 per cent.  The low rate of mortality in the South-western counties
renders it certain that, but for migrations, the ratio of enumerated
population to the corresponding births would be higher than 62.2 in that
division; in the other divisions it would be lower.

{20}  I am of opinion that the gain in this column, so far as regards
London death-rates, is due to the departure of many women when in bad
health, some of whom die in the country.  But for the effect of such
departures, the recorded deaths and the apparent net gain by migrations
would reach higher numbers.

{22}  The procedure for instance in 1881 might be:—Take the English
population at each age in 1871 as already corrected, and introduce the
numbers of births returned in 1876–80 and 1871–75 as the first two terms
of the series, adding a reasonable allowance for non-registration.
Deduct the deaths in 1871–80, duly apportioned under periods of birth.
The gross number of either sex enumerated in 1881 being known, the net
loss or gain by migrations can then be ascertained.  Apportion this in
somewhat similar proportions to those observed in 1851–60.  The final
results will exhibit approximately the distribution of population by ages
in 1881.

{23a}  It will be noticed that I have paid no regard to the interval of
time between the census day and the January preceding, treating the exact
decennium as being a near enough equivalent of the interval between
census and census.

{23b}  These numbers represent the births in the periods mentioned,
_plus_ an allowance for omissions, viz. 1¾ per cent. on births in
1866–70, and 2, 2¼, and 3½ per cent. on births in the earlier periods
respectively.

{23c}  The correction adopted in the case of female births is rather
larger than in that of male births.  These figures are those returned,
_plus_ 2 per cent. on the births in 1866–70, and 2¼, 2¾, and 4 per cent.
respectively on the births in the earlier periods.

{24a}   Births, plus allowance for those unregistered, say 2 per cent. on
births in 1866–70, and 2¾, 3¼, and 4 per cent. respectively on births in
the earlier periods.

{24b}  The few deaths “age not stated” are disregarded.

{25a}  Births, _plus_ allowance for those unregistered, say 1½ per cent.
on births in 1866–70, and 2¼, 2.65 and 3.5 per cent. respectively on
births in the earlier periods.

{25b}  The few deaths “are not stated” are disregarded.

{25c}  These figures are, I think, improbable; I suppose the
apportionment of deaths may be chiefly in fault.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
